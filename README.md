## Introduction
Their are few tutorials demonstrating simple crud app in spring mvc, some demonstrate login and logout, but couldn't find a beginner friendly project having all in one place. So I created in web application using spring mvc and some other backend technologies having all the above features at one project. For a developer who is willing to getting started with spring, it's a wonderful project for them.
